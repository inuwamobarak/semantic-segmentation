# Image Semantic Segmentation using Depth Prediction Transformers (DPTs)

This repository provides an implementation of Image Semantic Segmentation using Depth Prediction Transformers (DPTs), a powerful approach for pixel-level labeling in computer vision tasks. DPTs leverage the transformer architecture and an encoder-decoder framework to capture global context, model long-range dependencies, and generate accurate segmentation maps. This readme file provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.

## Introduction
Image Semantic Segmentation using Depth Prediction Transformers (DPTs) is a powerful technique in computer vision that assigns specific labels to each pixel in an image, enabling fine-grained analysis and understanding of the image content. This repository explores the concept of using DPTs for image semantic segmentation, highlighting the architecture, benefits, and potential applications of this approach. It also discusses future perspectives and emerging trends in the field.

## Installation
To use the Image Semantic Segmentation using DPTs, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-segmentation-dpt.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the pre-trained DPT model weights or train the model using your own dataset.
4. Run the provided scripts or integrate the DPT model into your own codebase.

## Usage
1. Import the necessary modules: `import dpt_segmentation`
2. Load the pre-trained DPT model: `model = dpt_segmentation.load_model('path/to/model.weights')`
3. Preprocess the input image: `image = dpt_segmentation.preprocess_image('path/to/image.jpg')`
4. Perform image semantic segmentation: `segmentation_map = model.predict(image)`
5. Visualize or analyze the segmentation map for further tasks.
